      <p>My name is Kevin Wesley Miller and I am currently working to become a web developer. 
        I have spent most of my career life working in the service industry as a repair technician. 
        The service field a very different industry than the coding field, but I feel I can use the skills that
         I have learned throughout the years and apply them to the coding industry. 
         I feel that my strengths in diagnosing issues and helping customers understand
          their products and the services could and allow customers to better understand
           their investments in internet technologies. While not busy practicing the art of Web coding
           I am currently working on learning to code one of my favorite games Space Station 13. It is best described as a 
           medium sized atmospheric roleplay game. The game itself is almost 20 years old and was developed as freeware
            over the years and as a new member of the community I would like to take part and contribute what I can 
            to a game that I truly enjoy.
